---

## AI Act Classification

### Why NOT "Administration of Justice" (Annex III)?

The EU AI Act defines **high-risk AI** in Annex III, Section 8(a):

> AI systems intended to be used by a judicial authority or on their behalf to **assist a judicial authority in researching and interpreting facts and the law** and in **applying the law to a concrete set of facts**, or to be used in a similar way in alternative dispute resolution.

**Key Criteria for High-Risk Classification:**
1. **User**: Judicial authority (courts, prosecutors, judges)
2. **Purpose**: Assist in **case outcomes** (sentencing, liability determinations, judgments)
3. **Context**: Application of law to **concrete cases** with direct legal consequences

### This Tool Does NOT Meet High-Risk Criteria

| Criterion | This Tool | High-Risk Example |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **User** | Lawyers, legal researchers, general public | Courts, prosecutors, judges |
| **Purpose** | Legal research and information retrieval | Case outcome determination, sentencing recommendations |
| **Function** | Search and retrieve statutory text, case law | Analyze evidence, recommend verdicts, predict case outcomes |
| **Output** | Database query results (citations, provisions) | Legal conclusions, risk assessments, sentencing scores |
| **Decision Impact** | No direct legal consequences | Direct impact on judicial decisions |

**Correct Classification**: **General-Purpose AI System** used for legal research, not administration of justice.

**Analogies:**
- ✅ **This Tool** = LexisNexis, Westlaw, or Google Scholar for legal research (not high-risk)
- ❌ **High-Risk** = COMPAS (criminal sentencing risk scores), predictive policing algorithms

✅ **Professional Use Guidance**: Workflow recommendations for lawyers and legal professionals

✅ **Staleness Warnings**: Runtime metadata alerts users to data currency issues

---

## Obligations This Tool Does NOT Have

Because this is **NOT a high-risk AI system**, it is NOT subject to:

❌ **Conformity Assessment** (Article 43): No third-party audit or certification required
❌ **CE Marking** (Article 48): No CE marking or Declaration of Conformity needed
❌ **Risk Management System** (Article 9): No formal risk management documentation required
❌ **Data Governance** (Article 10): No special training data governance requirements
❌ **Technical Documentation** (Article 11): No technical documentation file required
❌ **Automatic Logging** (Article 12): No mandatory logging of AI system operations
❌ **Human Oversight** (Article 14): No human-in-the-loop enforcement required
❌ **Accuracy Requirements** (Article 15): No specific accuracy, robustness, or cybersecurity requirements
❌ **Notified Body Involvement**: No third-party conformity assessment needed
❌ **Post-Market Monitoring** (Article 72): No formal post-market surveillance regime required

**Caveat**: If this Tool were modified to provide **case outcome predictions**, **sentencing recommendations**, or **direct judicial assistance**, it would become **high-risk** and require full compliance.

---

## Voluntary Best Practices (Beyond Legal Requirements)

Even though not legally required for general-purpose AI, this Tool implements:

### Accuracy and Robustness (Article 15 Principles)

✅ **Verified Data Sources**: Minimizes hallucination risk by returning only verified database entries (all data validated against official sources)
✅ **Source Verification**: All provisions and cases mapped to official sources
✅ **Error Boundaries**: Returns `null` or empty results rather than guessing
✅ **Metadata Transparency**: Every response includes data freshness and source authority

### Human Oversight (Article 14 Principles)

✅ **Professional Guidance**: [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) emphasizes human review requirement
✅ **Verification Workflow**: Documents step-by-step verification with official sources
✅ **No Automation of Legal Decisions**: Tool explicitly disclaims legal advice

### Post-Market Monitoring (Article 72 Principles)

✅ **GitHub Issue Tracking**: Users report bugs and data quality issues
✅ **Version Control**: All changes tracked in Git for auditability
✅ **Changelog**: Document updates and improvements

---

## Risk Analysis (Voluntary)

Although not required for general-purpose AI, this analysis identifies potential misuse risks:

### Low-Risk Uses (Intended)

✅ General legal research
✅ Statute lookup for academic study
✅ Preliminary case law search
✅ Legal education and teaching

### Medium-Risk Uses (Requires Caution)

⚠️ Professional legal work (with verification)
⚠️ Client advice (with disclaimer and verification)
⚠️ Legal drafting (cite official sources, not Tool)

### High-Risk Uses (Not Supported / Not Intended)

🚫 **Judicial decision support** → Would trigger Annex III high-risk classification
🚫 **Sentencing recommendations** → High-risk under Annex III
🚫 **Sole basis for legal advice** → Professional malpractice risk
🚫 **Unverified citations in court filings** → Professional misconduct

**Mitigation**: [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) explicitly prohibits high-risk uses and warns of malpractice risks.

## Comparison with High-Risk AI Systems

### If This Tool WERE Used for "Administration of Justice"

**Scenario**: Court deploys this Tool to assist judges in finding relevant precedents during sentencing.

**Result**: Would become **high-risk** under Annex III, Section 8(a)

**Additional Requirements**:
- Full conformity assessment by notified body
- CE marking and Declaration of Conformity
- Risk management system (ISO 31000 or equivalent)
- Training data governance and bias mitigation
- Technical documentation file (thousands of pages)
- Automatic logging of all judicial queries
- Human oversight measures (judge must review all suggestions)
- Accuracy and robustness testing
- Post-market monitoring and incident reporting
- Registration in EU AI database

**Cost Estimate**: €100,000 - €500,000 for conformity assessment and compliance

**Current Status**: This Tool is NOT deployed in this manner and explicitly disclaims such use.

---

## Professional Use Context

### Legal Research Tools Are Generally NOT High-Risk

**Precedent**: Commercial legal databases (Karnov, Westlaw, LexisNexis) are NOT high-risk AI under the EU AI Act because:

1. **User is lawyer/researcher**, not judge deciding a case
2. **Purpose is research**, not case outcome determination
3. **No direct legal consequences** — lawyer exercises independent judgment
4. **Human in the loop** — lawyer verifies and applies findings

**This Tool** follows the same model as these established legal research platforms.

---

## Compliance Monitoring

### How We Track Compliance

1. **Documentation Review**: Annual review of DISCLAIMER.md, PRIVACY.md, and this file
2. **User Feedback**: Monitor GitHub issues for misuse reports or AI Act concerns
3. **Legislative Updates**: Track EU AI Act implementing acts and guidance
4. **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Review public discussions to detect high-risk misuse

### Incident Response

**If High-Risk Misuse Detected**:
1. Update documentation to explicitly prohibit
2. Consider technical controls (e.g., block queries referencing case IDs)
3. Notify users of Terms of Service violation
4. Report to relevant authorities if required
