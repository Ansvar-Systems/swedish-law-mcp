The Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes which are imposed after the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, the taxes referred to in paragraph 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any substantial changes which have been made in their respective taxation laws. CHAPTER II DEFINITIONS Article 3 General definitions 1. For the purposes of this Convention, unless the context otherwise requires: a) the term \"Portugal\" means the territory of the Portuguese Republic situated in the European Continent, the Archipelagoes of Azores and Madeira, the respective territorial sea and any other zone in which, according to Portuguese and International Law, the Portuguese Republic has sovereign rights or jurisdiction for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the sea-bed and of the sea-bed and its subsoil; b) the term \"Sweden\" means the Kingdom of Sweden and, when used in a geographical sense, includes the national territory, the territorial sea of Sweden as well as other maritime areas over which Sweden in accordance with international law exercises sovereign rights or jurisdiction; c) the terms \"a Contracting State\" and \"the other Contracting State\" mean Portugal or Sweden, as the context requires; the term \"the Contracting States\" means Portugal and Sweden; d) the term \"person\" includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; e) the term \"company\" means any body corporate or any entity which is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; f) the terms \"enterprise of a Contracting State\" and \"enterprise of the other Contracting State\" mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; g) the term \"international traffic\" means any transport by ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State; h) the term \"national\" means: (1) all individuals possessing the nationality of a Contracting State; (2) any legal person, association or other entity deriving its status as such from the laws in force in a Contracting State; i) the term \"competent authority\" means: (1) in the case of Portugal, the Minister of Finance, the Director General of Taxation (Director Geral dos Impostos) or their authorized representative; (2) in the case of Sweden, the Minister of Finance, his authorized representative or the authority which is designated as a competent authority for the purposes of this Convention. 2. As regards the application of the Convention at any time by a Contracting State any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Convention applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. Article 4 Resident 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term \"resident of a Contracting State\" means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State, any governmental body or agency, political or administrative subdivision or local authority thereof. But this term does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. However, this term applies also in the case of a Swedish partnership, but only to the extent that the income derived by such partnership is subject to tax in Sweden as the income of a resident, either in its hands or in the hands of its partners. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows: a) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); b) if the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has an habitual abode; c) if he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which he is a national; d) if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to settle the question by mutual agreement. Article 5 Permanent establishment 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term \"permanent establishment\" means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term \"permanent establishment\" includes especially: a) a place of management; b) a branch; c) an office; d) a factory; e) a workshop; and f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources. 3. a) A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment only if it lasts more than six months within any twelve month period. b) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 4, 6 and 7 of this Article, an enterprise of a Contracting State which is furnishing services including consultancy services through employees or other personnel in the other Contracting State shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that other State but only where such activity lasts for more than six months within any twelve month period. 4. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term \"permanent establishment\" shall be deemed not to include: a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character; f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs a) to e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person - other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 6 applies - is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such a person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 6. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. 7. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. CHAPTER III TAXATION OF INCOME Article 6 Income from immovable property 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term \"immovable property\" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, buildings, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to income from movable property or income derived from services connected with the use or the right to use immovable property which, under the taxation law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated, is assimilated to income from immovable property. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services. Article 7 Business profits 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 5. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 6. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. Article 8 Shipping and air transport 1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. Article 9 Associated enterprises 1. Where: a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits where that other State considers the adjustment justified. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. Article 10 Dividends 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends. The provisions of the previous sentence shall not apply with respect to dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State with respect to which the provisions of the Directive on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States (90/435/EEC) as it may be changed from time to time, are applicable. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. The term \"dividends\" as used in this Article means income from shares, \"jouissance\" shares or \"jouissance\" rights, mining shares, founders' shares or other rights, not being debt- claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. The term \"dividends\" as used in this Article also comprises profits paid under an arrangement for participation in profits (associação em participação). 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5.Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. Article 11 Interest 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 interest, mentioned in paragraph 1, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State where the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident if one of the following requirements is fulfilled; (a) the payer or the recipient of the interest is the Contracting State itself, a statutory body, a political or administrative subdivision or a local authority thereof or the Central Bank of a Contracting State; (b) the interest is paid in respect of a loan granted by Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD), Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU), Instituto de Apoio às Pequenas e Médias Empresas e Investimento (IAPMEI), Investimento e Comércio Externo Português (ICEP), Companhia de Seguros de Crédito (COSEC), Organismo Coordenador do POE, Fundo de Internacionalização das Empresas Portuguesas (FIEP) or any other institution of a public character with the objective to promote exports or development; (c) the interest is paid in respect of a loan granted by The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), The Swedish Export Credit Corporation (SEK), Swedfund International AB, The Swedish Export Credits Guarantee Board (Exportkreditnämnden) or any other institution of a public character with the objective to promote exports or development; (d) the interest is paid in respect of a loan granted by any other financial institution which may be agreed upon between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. 4. The term \"interest\" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures as well as all other income assimilated to income from money lent by the taxation law of the State in which the income arises. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt- claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. Article 12 Royalties 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation. 3. The term \"royalties\" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films and films or tapes for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience. The term \"royalties\" also includes payments in consideration for technical assistance in connection with the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, goods or information as referred to under this paragraph. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the obligation to pay these royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last- mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. Article 13 Capital gains 1. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) or of such fixed base, may be taxed in that other State. 3. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State. 4. Gains derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares or other corporate rights in an entity which is a resident of the other Contracting State, and gains from the alienation of any other securities which are subjected in that other State to the same taxation treatment as gains from the alienation of such shares or other rights, may be taxed in that other Contracting State, but only if: a) the individual has been a resident of that other Contracting State at any time during the five years immediately preceding the alienation of the shares, rights or securities; and b) the individual was the owner of the above mentioned shares, rights or securities while he was a resident of that other State. 5. Gains from the alienation of any property other than that referred to in paragraphs 1-4 shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident. Article 14 Independent personal services 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State. However, in the following circumstances such income may be taxed in the other Contracting State: a) if he has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing his activities; in such case, only so much of the income as is attributable to that fixed base may be taxed in that other Contracting State; or b) if his stay in the other Contracting State is for a period or periods amounting to or exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any period of 12 months; in such case, only so much of the income as is attributable to services performed in that other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term \"professional services\" includes especially independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as the independent activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants. Article 15 Dependent personal services 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18 and 19, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned; and b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State; and c) the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic by an enterprise of a Contracting State, may be taxed in that State. Article 16 Directors' fees Directors' fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in his capacity as a member of the board of directors or supervisory board (in Portugal, conselho fiscal) or of another similar organ of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. However, Article 15 shall apply in relation to payments made by such a company to a member of any board or organ referred to above in respect of the exercise of a permanent or regular activity. Article 17 Artistes and athletes 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 14 and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as an athlete, from his personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or an athlete in his capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or athlete himself but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or athlete are exercised. Article 18 Pensions Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 19, pensions and other similar remuneration paid to a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that State. Article 19 Government service 1. a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, other than a pension, paid by a Contracting State or a political or administrative subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State. b) However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: (1) is a national of that State; or (2) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. a) Any pension paid by, or out of funds created by, a Contracting State or a political or administrative subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State. b) However, such pension shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the individual is a resident of, and a national of, that State. 3. The provisions of Articles 15, 16, 17 and 18 shall apply to salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, and to pensions, in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political or administrative subdivision or a local authority thereof. Article 20 Students Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first- mentioned State solely for the purpose of his education or training receives for the purpose of his maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. Article 21 Other income 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that other State. 4. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Convention, disbursements under the Social Security legislation arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the first-mentioned State. CHAPTER IV METHODS FOR ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION Article 22 Elimination of double taxation 1. In the case of Portugal, double taxation shall be avoided as follows: a) Where a resident of Portugal derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention may be taxed in Sweden, Portugal shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in Sweden. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Sweden; b) Where in accordance with any provision of the Convention income derived by a resident of Portugal is exempt from tax in this State Portugal may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of such resident, take into account the exempted income. 2. In the case of Sweden, double taxation shall be avoided as follows: a) Where a resident of Sweden derives income which under the laws of Portugal and in accordance with the provisions of this Convention may be taxed in Portugal, Sweden shall allow - subject to the provisions of the laws of Sweden concerning credit for foreign tax (as it may be amended from time to time without changing the general principle hereof) - as a deduction from the tax on such income, an amount equal to the Portuguese tax paid in respect of such income. b) Where a resident of Sweden derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, shall be taxable only in Portugal, Sweden may, when determining the graduated rate of Swedish tax, take into account the income which shall be taxable only in Portugal. c) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Portugal to a company which is a resident of Sweden shall be exempt from Swedish tax according to the provisions of Swedish law governing the exemption of tax on dividends paid to Swedish companies by companies abroad. CHAPTER V SPECIAL PROVISIONS Article 23 Non-discrimination 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents. 3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 7 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first- mentioned State. 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected. 5. The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description. Article 24 Mutual agreement procedure 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 23, to that of the Contracting State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting State. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. Article 25 Exchange of information 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for the carrying out of the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by this Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 2. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). Article 26 Assistance in recovery 1. The Contracting States agree to provide mutual assistance and support for recovering, in accordance with the respective provisions and rules of their legislation or regulations, the taxes covered by this Convention, when these amounts are definitely due under the laws and regulations of the Contracting States seeking the assistance for such recovery. 2. At the request of the applicant State, the requested State shall, with a view to the recovery of an amount of tax, take measures of conservancy even if the claim is contested or is not yet the subject of an instrument permitting enforcement, insofar as such is permitted by the laws and administrative practice of the requested State. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall consult each other to decide the mode of application of this Article in case they consider the rendering of assistance in recovery of taxes feasible. Article 27 Limitations of benefits Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Convention, where a) a company that is a resident of a Contracting State derives its income primarily from other States (i) from activities of banking, shipping, financing or insurance or (ii) from being the headquarters, co-ordination centre or similar entity providing administrative services or other support to a group of companies which carry on business primarily in other States; and b) except for the application of the method of elimination of double taxation normally applied by that State, such income would bear a significantly lower tax under the laws of that State than income from similar activities carried out within that State or from being the headquarters, co-ordination centre or similar entity providing administrative services or other support to a group of companies which carry on business in that State, as the case may be, any provisions of this Convention conferring an exemption or a reduction of tax shall not apply to the income of such company and to the dividends paid by such company. Article 28 Diplomatic agents and consular officers Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic agents or consular officers under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. CHAPTER VI FINAL PROVISIONS Article 29 Entry into force The Convention shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the later of the dates on which the respective Governments have notified each other in writing that the formalities constitutionally required in their respective States have been complied with and its provisions shall have effect: a) in the case of Portugal: (i) in respect of taxes withheld at source the fact giving rise to them appearing on or after the first day of January 2000; (ii) in respect of other taxes as to income arising in the fiscal year beginning on or after the first day of January 2000; b) in the case of Sweden: (i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, for amounts paid on or after the first day of January 2000; (ii) in respect of other taxes on income, on taxes chargeable for any fiscal year beginning on or after the first day of January 2000. Article 30 Termination This Convention shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Convention, through diplomatic channels, by giving written notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year after the expiration of a period of three years from the date of its entry into force. In such event the Convention shall cease to have effect: a) in the case of Portugal: (i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, the fact giving rise to them appearing on or after the first day of January next following the date on which the period specified in the said notice of termination expires; (ii) in respect of other taxes as to income arising in the fiscal year beginning on or after the first day of January next following the date on which the period specified in the said notice of termination expires; b) in the case of Sweden: (i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, for amounts paid on or after the first day of January in the year next following the end of the six month period; (ii) in respect of other taxes on income, on taxes chargeable for any fiscal year beginning on or after the first day of January in the year next following the end of the six month period.

For the Kingdom of Sweden Anna Lindh For the Portuguese Republic António Martins da Cruz Avtal mellan Konungariket Sverige och Portugisiska Republiken för undvikande av dubbelbeskattning och förhindrande av skatteflykt beträffande skatter på inkomst Konungariket Sverige och Portugisiska Republiken, som önskar ingå ett avtal för undvikande av dubbelbeskattning och förhindrande av skatteflykt beträffande skatter på inkomst, har kommit överens om följande: KAPITEL I AVTALETS TILLÄMPNINGSOMRÅDE Artikel 1 Personer på vilka avtalet tillämpas Detta avtal tillämpas på personer som har hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat eller i båda avtalsslutande staterna. Artikel 2 Skatter som omfattas av avtalet 1. Detta avtal tillämpas på skatter på inkomst som påförs för en avtalsslutande stats, dess politiska eller administrativa underavdelningars eller lokala myndigheters räkning oberoende av det sätt på vilket skatterna tas ut. 2. Med skatter på inkomst förstås alla skatter som tas ut på inkomst i dess helhet eller på delar av inkomst, däri inbegripet skatter på vinst på grund av överlåtelse av lös eller fast egendom, samt skatter på värdestegring. 3. De för närvarande utgående skatter på vilka detta avtal tillämpas är: a) i Portugal: 1. skatten på fysisk persons inkomst ( Imposto sobre o Rendimento das Pessoas Singulares - IRS), 2. skatten på bolagsinkomst (Imposto sobre o Rendimento das Pessoas Colectivas - IRC), och 3. den lokala tilläggsskatten på bolagsskatten (Derrama), (i det följande benämnda \"portugisisk skatt\"); b) i Sverige: 1. den statliga inkomstskatten, 2. kupongskatten, 3. den särskilda inkomstskatten för utomlands bosatta, 4. den särskilda inkomstskatten för utomlands bosatta artister m.fl., och 5. den kommunala inkomstskatten, (i det följande benämnda \"svensk skatt\"). 4. Avtalet tillämpas även på skatter av samma eller i huvudsak likartat slag, som efter undertecknandet av avtalet påförs vid sidan av eller i stället för de skatter som anges i punkt 3. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna skall meddela varandra de väsentliga ändringar som gjorts i respektive skattelagstiftning. KAPITEL II DEFINITIONER Artikel 3 Allmänna definitioner 1. Om inte sammanhanget föranleder annat, har vid tillämpningen av detta avtal följande uttryck nedan angiven betydelse: a) \"Portugal\" avser Portugisiska Republikens territorium på den Europeiska kontinenten, Azorernas och Madeiras arkipelager, respektive territorialvatten och varje annan zon över vilken Portugisiska Republiken i överensstämmelse med portugisisk lag och folkrättens regler äger utöva suveräna rättigheter eller jurisdiktion i syfte att utforska och utnyttja, bevara och förvalta naturtillgångarna, såväl levande som döda, i vattnet ovanför havsbottnen, på havsbottnen eller i dess underlag; b) \"Sverige\" avser Konungariket Sverige och innefattar, när uttrycket används i geografisk betydelse, Sveriges territorium, Sveriges territorialvatten och andra havsområden över vilka Sverige, i överensstämmelse med folkrättens regler, utövar suveräna rättigheter eller jurisdiktion; c) \"en avtalsslutande stat\" och \"den andra avtalsslutande staten\" avser Portugal eller Sverige, beroende på sammanhanget; \"de avtalsslutande staterna\" avser Portugal och Sverige; d) \"person\" inbegriper fysisk person, bolag och annan sammanslutning; e) \"bolag\" avser juridisk person eller annan som vid beskattningen behandlas såsom juridisk person; f) \"företag i en avtalsslutande stat\" och \"företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten\" avser företag som bedrivs av person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat respektive företag som bedrivs av person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten; g) \"internationell trafik\" avser transport med skepp eller luftfartyg som används av företag i en avtalsslutande stat utom då skeppet eller luftfartyget används uteslutande mellan platser i den andra avtalsslutande staten; h) \"medborgare\" avser: 1) fysisk person som har medborgarskap i en avtalsslutande stat, 2) juridisk person, association eller annan sammanslutning som bildats enligt den lagstiftning som gäller i en avtalsslutande stat; i) \"behörig myndighet\" avser: 1) i Portugal: finansministern, Generaldirektören för beskattning (Director Geral dos Impostos) eller deras befullmäktigade ombud, och 2) i Sverige: finansministern, dennes befullmäktigade ombud eller den myndighet åt vilken uppdras att vara behörig myndighet vid tillämpningen av detta avtal. 2. Då en avtalsslutande stat tillämpar avtalet vid en viss tidpunkt anses, såvida inte sammanhanget föranleder annat, varje uttryck som inte definierats i avtalet ha den betydelse som uttrycket har vid denna tidpunkt enligt den statens lagstiftning i fråga om sådana skatter på vilka avtalet tillämpas och skall den betydelse uttrycket har enligt gällande skattelagstiftning i nämnda stat äga företräde framför den betydelse uttrycket har enligt någon annan lagstiftning i denna stat. Artikel 4 Hemvist 1. Vid tillämpningen av detta avtal avser uttrycket \"person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat\" person som enligt lagstiftningen i denna stat är skattskyldig där på grund av domicil, bosättning, plats för företagsledning eller annan liknande omständighet och innefattar också denna stat, dess offentligrättsliga organ eller institutioner, politiska eller administrativa underavdelningar och lokala myndigheter. Detta uttryck inbegriper emellertid inte person som är skattskyldig i denna stat endast för inkomst från källa i denna stat. Uttrycket inbegriper emellertid dessutom svenskt handelsbolag, dock endast i den utsträckning handelsbolagets inkomst är skattepliktig i Sverige på samma sätt som inkomst som förvärvas av en person med hemvist där, antingen hos handelsbolaget eller hos dess delägare. 2. Då på grund av bestämmelserna i punkt 1 fysisk person har hemvist i båda avtalsslutande staterna, bestäms hans hemvist på följande sätt: a) han anses ha hemvist endast i den stat där han har en bostad som stadigvarande står till hans förfogande. Om han har en sådan bostad i båda staterna, anses han ha hemvist endast i den stat med vilken hans personliga och ekonomiska förbindelser är starkast (centrum för levnadsintressena); b) om det inte kan avgöras i vilken stat han har centrum för sina levnadsintressen eller om han inte i någondera staten har en bostad som stadigvarande står till hans förfogande, anses han ha hemvist endast i den stat där han stadigvarande vistas; c) om han stadigvarande vistas i båda staterna eller om han inte vistas stadigvarande i någon av dem, anses han ha hemvist endast i den stat där han är medborgare; d) om han är medborgare i båda staterna eller om han inte är medborgare i någon av dem, skall de behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna avgöra frågan genom ömsesidig överenskommelse. 3. Då på grund av bestämmelserna i punkt 1 annan person än fysisk person har hemvist i båda avtalsslutande staterna, skall de behöriga myndigheterna söka avgöra frågan genom ömsesidig överenskommelse. Artikel 5 Fast driftställe 1. Vid tillämpningen av detta avtal avser uttrycket \"fast driftställe\" en stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet, från vilken ett företags verksamhet helt eller delvis bedrivs. 2. Uttrycket \"fast driftställe\" innefattar särskilt: a) plats för företagsledning, b) filial, c) kontor, d) fabrik, e) verkstad, och f) gruva, olje- eller gaskälla, stenbrott eller annan plats för utvinning av naturtillgångar. 3. a) Plats för byggnads-, anläggnings- eller installationsverksamhet utgör fast driftställe endast om verksamheten pågår längre än sex månader under en tolvmånadersperiod. b) Om inte bestämmelserna i punkterna 4, 6 och 7 i denna artikel föranleder annat, skall ett företag, som tillhandahåller tjänster, inklusive rådgivning, genom anställda eller annan personal i den andra avtalsslutande staten, anses ha fast driftställe i denna andra stat men endast om denna verksamhet pågår längre än sex månader under en tolvmånadersperiod. 4. Utan hinder av föregående bestämmelser i denna artikel anses uttrycket \"fast driftställe\" inte innefatta: a) användningen av anordningar uteslutande för lagring, utställning eller utlämnande av företaget tillhöriga varor, b) innehavet av ett företaget tillhörigt varulager uteslutande för lagring, utställning eller utlämnande, c) innehavet av ett företaget tillhörigt varulager uteslutande för bearbetning eller förädling genom annat företags försorg, d) innehavet av stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet uteslutande för inköp av varor eller inhämtande av upplysningar för företaget, e) innehavet av stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet uteslutande för att för företaget bedriva annan verksamhet av förberedande eller biträdande art, f) innehavet av en stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet uteslutande för att kombinera verksamheter som anges i punkterna a-e, under förutsättning att hela den verksamhet som bedrivs från den stadigvarande platsen för affärsverksamhet på grund av denna kombination är av förberedande eller biträdande artikel 5. Om en person, som inte är sådan oberoende representant på vilken punkt 6 tillämpas, är verksam för ett företag samt i en avtalsslutande stat har och där regelmässigt använder fullmakt att sluta avtal i företagets namn, anses detta företag - utan hinder av bestämmelserna i punkterna 1 och 2 - ha fast driftställe i denna stat i fråga om varje verksamhet som denna person bedriver för företaget. Detta gäller dock inte, om den verksamhet som denna person bedriver är begränsad till sådan som anges i punkt 4 och som om den bedrevs från en stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet inte skulle göra denna stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet till fast driftställe enligt bestämmelserna i nämnda punkt. 6. Företag anses inte ha fast driftställe i en avtalsslutande stat endast på den grund att företaget bedriver affärsverksamhet i denna stat genom förmedling av mäklare, kommissionär eller annan oberoende representant, under förutsättning att sådan person därvid bedriver sin sedvanliga affärsverksamhet. 7. Den omständigheten att ett bolag med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat kontrollerar eller kontrolleras av ett bolag med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten eller ett bolag som bedriver affärsverksamhet i denna andra stat (antingen från fast driftställe eller på annat sätt), medför inte i och för sig att någotdera bolaget utgör fast driftställe för det andra. KAPITEL III BESKATTNING AV INKOMST Artikel 6 Inkomst av fast egendom 1. Inkomst, som person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar av fast egendom (däri inbegripet inkomst av lantbruk eller skogsbruk) belägen i den andra avtalsslutande staten, får beskattas i denna andra stat. 2. Uttrycket \"fast egendom\" har den betydelse som uttrycket har enligt lagstiftningen i den avtalsslutande stat där egendomen är belägen. Uttrycket inbegriper dock alltid tillbehör till fast egendom, levande och döda inventarier i lantbruk och skogsbruk, rättigheter på vilka bestämmelserna i privaträtten om fast egendom tillämpas, byggnader, nyttjanderätt till fast egendom samt rätt till föränderliga eller fasta ersättningar för nyttjandet av eller rätten att nyttja mineralförekomst, källa eller annan naturtillgång. Skepp och luftfartyg anses inte vara fast egendom. 3. Bestämmelserna i punkt 1 tillämpas på inkomst som förvärvas genom omedelbart brukande, genom uthyrning eller annan användning av fast egendom. Bestämmelserna i punkt 1 tillämpas också på inkomst av lös egendom eller från inkomst av tillhandahållandet av tjänster som har samband med brukandet eller rätten att bruka fast egendom som, enligt skattelagstiftningen i den avtalsslutande stat i vilken den fasta egendomen är belägen, innefattas i inkomst av fast egendom. 4. Bestämmelserna i punkterna 1 och 3 tillämpas även på inkomst av fast egendom som tillhör företag och på inkomst av fast egendom som används vid självständig yrkesutövning. Artikel 7 Inkomst av rörelse 1. Inkomst av rörelse, som företag i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar, beskattas endast i denna stat, såvida inte företaget bedriver rörelse i den andra avtalsslutande staten från där beläget fast driftställe. Om företaget bedriver rörelse på nyss angivet sätt, får företagets inkomst beskattas i den andra staten, men endast så stor del därav som är hänförlig till det fasta driftstället. 2. Om företag i en avtalsslutande stat bedriver rörelse i den andra avtalsslutande staten från där beläget fast driftställe hänförs, om inte bestämmelserna i punkt 3 föranleder annat, i vardera avtalsslutande staten till det fasta driftstället den inkomst som det kan antas att driftstället skulle ha förvärvat, om det varit ett fristående företag, som bedrivit verksamhet av samma eller liknande slag under samma eller liknande villkor och självständigt avslutat affärer med det företag till vilket driftstället hör. 3. Vid bestämmandet av fast driftställes inkomst får avdrag göras för utgifter som uppkommit för det fasta driftstället, härunder inbegripna utgifter för företagets ledning och allmänna förvaltning, oavsett om utgifterna uppkommit i den stat där det fasta driftstället är beläget eller annorstädes. 4. Inkomst hänförs inte till fast driftställe endast av den anledningen att varor inköps genom det fasta driftställets försorg för företaget. 5. Vid tillämpningen av föregående punkter bestäms inkomst som är hänförlig till det fasta driftstället genom samma förfarande år från år, såvida inte goda och tillräckliga skäl föranleder annat. 6. Ingår i inkomst av rörelse inkomst som behandlas särskilt i andra artiklar av detta avtal, berörs bestämmelserna i dessa artiklar inte av reglerna i denna artikel. Artikel 8 Sjöfart och luftfart 1. Inkomst som förvärvas av företag i en avtalsslutande stat genom användningen av skepp eller luftfartyg i internationell trafik beskattas endast i denna stat. 2. Bestämmelserna i punkt 1 tillämpas även på inkomst som förvärvas genom deltagande i en pool, ett gemensamt företag eller en internationell driftsorganisation. Artikel 9 Företag med intressegemenskap 1. I fall då a) ett företag i en avtalsslutande stat direkt eller indirekt deltar i ledningen eller kontrollen av ett företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten eller äger del i detta företags kapital, eller b) samma personer direkt eller indirekt deltar i ledningen eller kontrollen av såväl ett företag i en avtalsslutande stat som ett företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten eller äger del i båda dessa företags kapital, iakttas följande. Om mellan företagen i fråga om handelsförbindelser eller finansiella förbindelser avtalas eller föreskrivs villkor, som avviker från dem som skulle ha avtalats mellan av varandra oberoende företag, får all inkomst, som utan sådana villkor skulle ha tillkommit det ena företaget men som på grund av villkoren i fråga inte tillkommit detta företag, inräknas i detta företags inkomst och beskattas i överensstämmelse därmed. 2. I fall då en avtalsslutande stat i inkomsten för ett företag i denna stat inräknar - och i överensstämmelse därmed beskattar - inkomst, för vilken ett företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten beskattats i denna andra stat, samt den sålunda inräknade inkomsten är sådan som skulle ha tillkommit företaget i den förstnämnda staten om de villkor som avtalats mellan företagen hade varit sådana som skulle ha avtalats mellan av varandra oberoende företag, skall denna andra stat genomföra vederbörlig justering av det skattebelopp som påförts för inkomsten där om denna andra stat finner justeringen berättigad. Vid sådan justering iakttas övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal och de behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna överlägger vid behov med varandra. Artikel 10 Utdelning 1. Utdelning från bolag med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat till person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten får beskattas i denna andra stat. 2. Utdelningen får emellertid beskattas även i den avtalsslutande stat där bolaget som betalar utdelningen har hemvist, enligt lagstiftningen i denna stat, men om den som har rätt till utdelningen har hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten får skatten inte överstiga 10 procent av utdelningens bruttobelopp. Bestämmelserna i föregående mening skall inte tillämpas på utdelning som betalas av ett bolag med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat till ett bolag med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten på vilka bestämmelserna i Direktivet om ett gemensamt beskattningssystem för moderbolag och dotterbolag hemmahörande i olika medlemsstater (90/435/EEG) i den lydelse det framdeles kan få genom att ändras, är tillämpliga. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna kan träffa överenskommelse om sättet att genomföra dessa begränsningar. Bestämmelserna i denna punkt berör inte bolagets beskattning för den vinst av vilken utdelningen betalas. 3. Med uttrycket \"utdelning\" förstås i denna artikel inkomst av aktier, andelsbevis eller andra liknande bevis, gruvaktier, stiftarandelar eller andra rättigheter, som inte är fordringar, med rätt till andel i vinst, samt inkomst av andra andelar i bolag, som enligt lagstiftningen i den stat där det utdelande bolaget har hemvist vid beskattningen behandlas på samma sätt som inkomst av aktier. Uttrycket \"utdelning\" i denna artikel innefattar också vinst som betalas genom ett arrangemang med andel i vinst (associação em participação). 4. Bestämmelserna i punkterna 1 och 2 tillämpas inte, om den som har rätt till utdelningen har hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat och bedriver rörelse i den andra avtalsslutande staten, där bolaget som betalar utdelningen har hemvist, från där beläget fast driftställe eller utövar självständig yrkesverksamhet i denna andra stat från där belägen stadigvarande anordning, samt den andel på grund av vilken utdelningen betalas äger verkligt samband med det fasta driftstället eller den stadigvarande anordningen. I sådant fall tillämpas bestämmelserna i artikel 7 respektive artikel 14. 5. Om bolag med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar inkomst från den andra avtalsslutande staten, får denna andra stat inte beskatta utdelning som bolaget betalar, utom i den mån utdelningen betalas till person med hemvist i denna andra stat eller i den mån den andel på grund av vilken utdelningen betalas äger verkligt samband med fast driftställe eller stadigvarande anordning i denna andra stat, och ej heller på bolagets icke utdelade vinst ta ut en skatt som utgår på bolagets icke utdelade vinst, även om utdelningen eller den icke utdelade vinsten helt eller delvis utgörs av inkomst som uppkommit i denna andra stat. Artikel 11 Ränta 1. Ränta, som härrör från en avtalsslutande stat och som betalas till person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, får beskattas i denna andra stat. 2. Räntan får emellertid beskattas även i den avtalsslutande stat från vilken den härrör, enligt lagstiftningen i denna stat, men om den som har rätt till räntan har hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten får skatten inte överstiga 10 procent av räntans bruttobelopp. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna kan träffa överenskommelse om sättet att genomföra dessa begränsningar. 3. Ränta som anges i punkt 1 beskattas, utan hinder av bestämmelserna i punkt 2, endast i den avtalsslutande stat där den som har rätt till räntan har hemvist om någon av följande förutsättningar är uppfylld; a) den som betalar eller tar emot räntan är en avtalsslutande stat, dess offentligrättsliga organ, politiska eller administrativa underavdelning eller lokala myndighet eller centralbanken i en avtalsslutande stat, b) räntan betalas på grund av ett lån beviljat av Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD), Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU), Instituto de Apoio às Pequenas e Médias Empresas e Investimento (IAPMEI), Investimento e Comércio Externo Português (ICEP), Companhia de Seguros de Crédito (COSEC), Organismo Coordenador do POE, Fundo de Internacionalização das Empresas Portuguesas (FIEP) eller av en annan institution av offentligrättslig karaktär med syfte att främja export eller utveckling, c) räntan betalas på grund av ett lån beviljat av Styrelsen för internationellt utvecklingssamarbete (SIDA), AB Svensk Exportkredit (SEK), Swedfund International AB, Exportkreditnämnden, eller av en annan institution av offentligrättslig karaktär med syfte att främja export eller utveckling, d) räntan betalas på grund av ett lån beviljat av en annan finansiell institution som de behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna träffar överenskommelse om. 4. Med uttrycket \"ränta\" förstås i denna artikel inkomst av varje slags fordran, antingen den säkerställts genom inteckning i fast egendom eller inte och antingen den medför rätt till andel i gäldenärens vinst eller inte. Uttrycket avser särskilt inkomst av värdepapper som utfärdats av staten och inkomst av obligationer eller debentures, däri inbegripet agiobelopp och vinster som hänför sig till sådana värdepapper, obligationer eller debentures, liksom varje annan inkomst som innefattas i inkomst av utlånade pengar enligt skattelagstiftningen i den stat varifrån inkomsten härrör. Straffavgift på grund av sen betalning anses inte som ränta vid tillämpningen av denna artikel. 5. Bestämmelserna i punkterna 1, 2 och 3 tillämpas inte, om den som har rätt till räntan har hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat och bedriver rörelse i den andra avtalsslutande staten, från vilken räntan härrör, från där beläget fast driftställe eller utövar självständig yrkesverksamhet i denna andra stat från där belägen stadigvarande anordning, samt den fordran för vilken räntan betalas äger verkligt samband med det fasta driftstället eller den stadigvarande anordningen. I sådant fall tillämpas bestämmelserna i artikel 7 respektive artikel 14. 6. Ränta anses härröra från en avtalsslutande stat om utbetalaren är en person med hemvist i denna stat. Om emellertid den person som betalar räntan, antingen han har hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat eller inte, i en avtalsslutande stat har fast driftställe eller stadigvarande anordning i samband med vilken den skuld uppkommit för vilken räntan betalas, och räntan belastar det fasta driftstället eller den stadigvarande anordningen, anses räntan härröra från den stat där det fasta driftstället eller den stadigvarande anordningen finns. 7. Då på grund av särskilda förbindelser mellan utbetalaren och den som har rätt till räntan eller mellan dem båda och annan person räntebeloppet, med hänsyn till den fordran för vilken räntan betalas, överstiger det belopp som skulle ha avtalats mellan utbetalaren och den som har rätt till räntan om sådana förbindelser inte förelegat, tillämpas bestämmelserna i denna artikel endast på sistnämnda belopp. I sådant fall beskattas överskjutande belopp enligt lagstiftningen i vardera avtalsslutande staten med iakttagande av övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal. Artikel 12 Royalty 1. Royalty, som härrör från en avtalsslutande stat och som betalas till person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, får beskattas i denna andra stat. 2. Sådan royalty får emellertid beskattas även i den avtalsslutande stat från vilken den härrör, enligt lagstiftningen i denna stat, men om den som har rätt till royaltyn har hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten får skatten inte överstiga 10 procent av royaltyns bruttobelopp. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna kan träffa överenskommelse om sättet att genomföra dessa begränsningar. 3. Med uttrycket \"royalty\" förstås i denna artikel varje slags betalning som tas emot såsom ersättning för nyttjandet av eller för rätten att nyttja upphovsrätt till litterärt, konstnärligt eller vetenskapligt verk, häri inbegripet biograffilm och film eller band för radio- eller televisionsutsändning, patent, varumärke, mönster eller modell, ritning, hemligt recept eller hemlig tillverkningsmetod samt för nyttjandet av eller för rätten att nyttja industriell, kommersiell eller vetenskaplig utrustning eller för upplysning om erfarenhetsrön av industriell, kommersiell eller vetenskaplig natur. Uttrycket \"royalty\" innefattar också betalningar som utgör ersättning för tekniskt bistånd i samband med nyttjandet av eller i samband med rätten att nyttja sådan upphovsrätt, sådana alster eller upplysningar som anges i denna punkt. 4. Bestämmelserna i punkterna 1 och 2 tillämpas inte, om den som har rätt till royaltyn har hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat och bedriver rörelse i den andra avtalsslutande staten, från vilken royaltyn härrör, från där beläget fast driftställe eller utövar självständig yrkesverksamhet i denna andra stat från där belägen stadigvarande anordning, samt den rättighet eller egendom i fråga om vilken royaltyn betalas äger verkligt samband med det fasta driftstället eller den stadigvarande anordningen. I sådant fall tillämpas bestämmelserna i artikel 7 respektive artikel 14. 5. Royalty anses härröra från en avtalsslutande stat om utbetalaren är en person med hemvist i denna stat. Om, emellertid, den person som betalar royaltyn, antingen han har hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat eller inte, i en avtalsslutande stat har fast driftställe eller stadigvarande anordning i samband varmed skyldigheten att betala royaltyn uppkommit, och royaltyn belastar det fasta driftstället eller den stadigvarande anordningen, anses royaltyn härröra från den stat där det fasta driftstället eller den stadigvarande anordningen finns. 6. Då på grund av särskilda förbindelser mellan utbetalaren och den som har rätt till royaltyn eller mellan dem båda och annan person royaltybeloppet, med hänsyn till det nyttjande, den rättighet eller den upplysning för vilken royaltyn betalas, överstiger det belopp som skulle ha avtalats mellan utbetalaren och den som har rätt till royaltyn om sådana förbindelser inte förelegat, tillämpas bestämmelserna i denna artikel endast på sistnämnda belopp. I sådant fall beskattas överskjutande belopp enligt lagstiftningen i vardera avtalsslutande staten med iakttagande av övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal. Artikel 13 Realisationsvinst 1. Vinst, som person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar på grund av överlåtelse av sådan fast egendom som avses i artikel 6 och som är belägen i den andra avtalsslutande staten, får beskattas i denna andra stat. 2. Vinst på grund av överlåtelse av lös egendom, som utgör del av rörelsetillgångarna i fast driftställe, vilket ett företag i en avtalsslutande stat har i den andra avtalsslutande staten, eller av lös egendom, hänförlig till stadigvarande anordning för att utöva självständig yrkesverksamhet, som person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat har i den andra avtalsslutande staten, får beskattas i denna andra stat. Detsamma gäller vinst på grund av överlåtelse av sådant fast driftställe (för sig eller tillsammans med hela företaget) eller av sådan stadigvarande anordning. 3. Vinst som person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar på grund av överlåtelse av skepp eller luftfartyg som används i internationell trafik, eller lös egendom som är hänförlig till användningen av sådana skepp eller luftfartyg, beskattas endast i denna stat. 4. Vinst, som fysisk person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar på grund av överlåtelse av andelar eller andra rättigheter i företag som har hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten och vinst från överlåtelse av varje slag av värdepapper, som i denna andra stat behandlas på samma sätt som vinst vid överlåtelse av sådana andelar och andra rättigheter, får beskattas i denna andra avtalsslutande stat, men endast om a) den fysiska personen har haft hemvist i denna andra avtalsslutande stat vid något tillfälle under en femårsperiod omedelbart före överlåtelsen av andelarna, rättigheterna eller värdepapperna; och b) den fysiska personen var ägare till ovan nämnda andelar, rättigheter eller värdepapper när han hade hemvist i denna andra stat. 5. Vinst på grund av överlåtelse av annan egendom än sådan som avses i punkterna 1-4 beskattas endast i den avtalsslutande stat där överlåtaren har hemvist. Artikel 14 Självständig yrkesutövning 1. Inkomst, som en person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar genom att utöva fritt yrke eller annan självständig verksamhet, beskattas endast i denna stat. Sådan inkomst får emellertid beskattas i den andra avtalsslutande staten om a) han i denna andra avtalsslutande stat har en stadigvarande anordning, som regelmässigt står till hans förfogande för att utöva verksamheten. I sådant fall får dock endast den del av inkomsten som är hänförlig till denna stadigvarande anordning beskattas i denna andra avtalsslutande stat; eller b) han vistas i denna andra avtalsslutande stat under tidsperiod eller tidsperioder som sammanlagt uppgår till eller överstiger 183 dagar under en tolvmånadersperiod. I sådant fall får dock endast den del av inkomsten som är hänförlig till den verksamhet som utövats i denna andra avtalsslutande stat beskattas i denna andra stat. 2. Uttrycket \"fritt yrke\" inbegriper särskilt självständig vetenskaplig, litterär och konstnärlig verksamhet, uppfostrings- och undervisningsverksamhet samt sådan självständig verksamhet som läkare, advokat, ingenjör, arkitekt, tandläkare och revisor utövar. Artikel 15 Enskild tjänst 1. Om inte bestämmelserna i artiklarna 16, 18 och 19 föranleder annat, beskattas lön och annan liknande ersättning som person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat uppbär på grund av anställning, endast i denna stat, såvida inte arbetet utförs i den andra avtalsslutande staten. Om arbetet utförs i denna andra stat, får ersättning som uppbärs för arbetet beskattas där. 2. Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i punkt 1 beskattas ersättning, som person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat uppbär för arbete som utförs i den andra avtalsslutande staten, endast i den förstnämnda staten, om a) mottagaren vistas i den andra staten under tidsperiod eller tidsperioder som sammanlagt inte överstiger 183 dagar under en tolvmånadersperiod som börjar eller slutar under beskattningsåret i fråga, och b) ersättningen betalas av arbetsgivare som inte har hemvist i den andra staten eller på dennes vägnar, samt c) ersättningen inte belastar fast driftställe eller stadigvarande anordning som arbetsgivaren har i den andra staten. 3. Utan hinder av föregående bestämmelser i denna artikel får ersättning för arbete, som utförs ombord på skepp eller luftfartyg, som används i internationell trafik av ett företag i en avtalsslutande stat, beskattas i denna stat. Artikel 16 Styrelsearvode Styrelsearvode och annan liknande ersättning, som person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat uppbär i egenskap av medlem i styrelse eller i kontrollorgan (i Portugal, conselho fiscal) eller i annat liknande organ i bolag med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, får beskattas i denna andra stat. Artikel 15 skall emellertid tillämpas på ersättningar, för utövande av stadigvarande eller regelbunden verksamhet, som betalas av ett sådant bolag till medlem i en sådan styrelse eller ett sådant organ som anges ovan. Artikel 17 Artister och sportutövare 1. Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i artiklarna 14 och 15 får inkomst, som person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar genom sin personliga verksamhet i den andra avtalsslutande staten i egenskap av underhållningsartist, såsom teater- eller filmskådespelare, radio- eller televisionsartist eller musiker, eller i egenskap av sportutövare, beskattas i denna andra stat. 2. I fall då inkomst genom personlig verksamhet, som underhållningsartist eller sportutövare bedriver i denna egenskap, inte tillfaller underhållningsartisten eller sportutövaren själv utan annan person, får denna inkomst, utan hinder av bestämmelserna i artiklarna 7, 14 och 15, beskattas i den avtalsslutande stat där underhållningsartisten eller sportutövaren bedriver verksamheten. Artikel 18 Pension Om inte bestämmelserna i artikel 19 punkt 2 föranleder annat, beskattas pension och annan liknande ersättning, som med anledning av tidigare anställning betalas till person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat, endast i denna stat. Artikel 19 Offentlig tjänst 1. a) Lön och annan liknande ersättning (med undantag för pension), som betalas av en avtalsslutande stat, en av dess politiska eller administrativa underavdelningar eller lokala myndigheter till fysisk person på grund av arbete som utförts i denna stats, underavdelnings eller myndighets tjänst, beskattas endast i denna stat. b) Sådan lön och annan liknande ersättning beskattas emellertid endast i den andra avtalsslutande staten om arbetet utförs i denna stat och personen i fråga har hemvist i denna stat och 1) är medborgare i denna stat, eller 2) inte fick hemvist i denna stat uteslutande för att utföra arbetet. 2. a) Pension som betalas av, eller från fonder inrättade av, en avtalsslutande stat, en av dess politiska eller administrativa underavdelningar eller lokala myndigheter till fysisk person på grund av arbete som utförts i denna stats, underavdelnings eller myndighets tjänst, beskattas endast i denna stat. b) Sådan pension beskattas emellertid endast i den andra avtalsslutande staten om personen i fråga har hemvist och är medborgare i denna stat. 3. Bestämmelserna i artiklarna 15, 16, 17 och 18 tillämpas på lön och annan liknande ersättning och på pension som betalas på grund av arbete som utförts i samband med rörelse som bedrivs av en avtalsslutande stat, en av dess politiska eller administrativa underavdelningar eller lokala myndigheter. Artikel 20 Studerande Studerande eller affärspraktikant, som har eller omedelbart före vistelsen i en avtalsslutande stat hade hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten och som vistas i den förstnämnda staten uteslutande för sin undervisning eller praktik, beskattas inte i denna stat för belopp som han erhåller för sitt uppehälle, sin undervisning eller praktik, under förutsättning att beloppen härrör från källa utanför denna stat. Artikel 21 Annan inkomst 1. Inkomst som person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar och som inte behandlas i föregående artiklar av detta avtal beskattas endast i denna stat, oavsett varifrån inkomsten härrör. 2. Bestämmelserna i punkt 1 tillämpas inte på inkomst, med undantag för inkomst av fast egendom som avses i artikel 6 punkt 2, om mottagaren av inkomsten har hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat och bedriver rörelse i den andra avtalsslutande staten från där beläget fast driftställe eller utövar självständig yrkesverksamhet i denna andra stat från där belägen stadigvarande anordning, samt den rättighet eller egendom i fråga om vilken inkomsten betalas äger verkligt samband med det fasta driftstället eller den stadigvarande anordningen. I sådant fall tillämpas bestämmelserna i artikel 7 respektive artikel 14. 3. Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i punkterna 1 och 2 får inkomst som person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar och som inte behandlas i föregående artiklar av detta avtal och som härrör från den andra avtalsslutande staten, beskattas i denna andra stat. 4. Utan hinder av övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal får utbetalningar enligt socialförsäkringslagstiftningen, som härrör från en avtalsslutande stat och som betalas till en person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, beskattas i den förstnämnda staten. KAPITEL IV METODER FÖR ATT UNDVIKA DUBBELBESKATTNING Artikel 22 Undanröjande av dubbelbeskattning 1. Beträffande Portugal skall dubbelbeskattning undvikas på följande sätt: a) Om person med hemvist i Portugal förvärvar inkomst som enligt bestämmelserna i detta avtal får beskattas i Sverige, skall Portugal, från skatten på denna persons inkomst avräkna ett belopp motsvarande den skatt som betalats i Sverige. Avräkningsbeloppet skall emellertid inte överstiga den del av inkomstskatten, beräknad utan sådan avräkning, som belöper på den inkomst som får beskattas i Sverige. b) Om person med hemvist i Portugal förvärvar inkomst som enligt bestämmelserna i detta avtal är undantagen från beskattning i denna stat, får Portugal vid fastställandet av skatteuttaget för återstående inkomst för sådan person beakta den inkomst som undantagits från beskattning. 2. Beträffande Sverige skall dubbelbeskattning undvikas på följande sätt: a) Om person med hemvist i Sverige förvärvar inkomst som enligt portugisisk lagstiftning och i enlighet med bestämmelserna i detta avtal får beskattas i Portugal, skall Sverige - med beaktande av bestämmelserna i svensk lagstiftning beträffande avräkning av utländsk skatt (även i den lydelse de framdeles kan få genom att ändras utan att den allmänna princip som anges här ändras) - från den svenska skatten på inkomsten avräkna ett belopp motsvarande den portugisiska skatt som erlagts på inkomsten. b) Om person med hemvist i Sverige förvärvar inkomst som enligt bestämmelserna i detta avtal beskattas endast i Portugal, får Sverige vid fastställandet av skattesatsen för svensk progressiv skatt beakta den inkomst som skall beskattas endast i Portugal. c) Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i a) ovan är utdelning från bolag med hemvist i Portugal till bolag med hemvist i Sverige undantagen från svensk skatt enligt bestämmelserna i svensk lag om skattebefrielse för utdelning som betalas till svenska bolag från bolag i utlandet. KAPITEL V SÄRSKILDA BESTÄMMELSER Artikel 23 Förbud mot diskriminering 1. Medborgare i en avtalsslutande stat skall inte i den andra avtalsslutande staten bli föremål för beskattning eller därmed sammanhängande krav som är av annat slag eller mer tyngande än den beskattning och därmed sammanhängande krav som medborgare i denna andra stat under samma förhållanden är eller kan bli underkastad. Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i artikel 1 tillämpas denna bestämmelse även på person som inte har hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat eller i båda avtalsslutande staterna. 2. Beskattningen av fast driftställe, som företag i en avtalsslutande stat har i den andra avtalsslutande staten, skall i denna andra stat inte vara mindre fördelaktig än beskattningen av företag i denna andra stat, som bedriver verksamhet av samma slag. Denna bestämmelse anses inte medföra skyldighet för en avtalsslutande stat att medge person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten sådant personligt avdrag vid beskattningen, sådan skattebefrielse eller skattenedsättning på grund av civilstånd eller försörjningsplikt mot familj som medges person med hemvist i den egna staten. 3. Utom i de fall då bestämmelserna i artikel 9 punkt 1, artikel 11 punkt 7 eller artikel 12 punkt 6 tillämpas, är ränta, royalty och annan betalning från företag i en avtalsslutande stat till person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten avdragsgilla vid bestämmandet av den beskattningsbara inkomsten för sådant företag på samma villkor som betalning till person med hemvist i den förstnämnda staten. På samma sätt är skuld som företag i en avtalsslutande stat har till person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten avdragsgill vid bestämmandet av sådant företags beskattningsbara förmögenhet på samma villkor som skuld till person med hemvist i den förstnämnda staten. 4. Företag i en avtalsslutande stat, vars kapital helt eller delvis ägs eller kontrolleras, direkt eller indirekt, av en eller flera personer med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, skall inte i den förstnämnda staten bli föremål för beskattning eller därmed sammanhängande krav som är av annat slag eller mer tyngande än den beskattning och därmed sammanhängande krav som annat liknande företag i den förstnämnda staten är eller kan bli underkastat. 5. Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i artikel 2 tillämpas bestämmelserna i denna artikel på skatter av varje slag och beskaffenhet. Artikel 24 Förfarandet vid ömsesidig överenskommelse 1. Om en person anser att en avtalsslutande stat eller båda avtalsslutande staterna vidtagit åtgärder som för honom medför eller kommer att medföra beskattning som strider mot bestämmelserna i detta avtal, kan han, utan att detta påverkar hans rätt att använda sig av de rättsmedel som finns i dessa staters interna rättsordning, lägga fram saken för den behöriga myndigheten i den avtalsslutande stat där personen har hemvist, eller om fråga är om tilllämpning av artikel 23 punkt 1, i den avtalsslutande stat där han är medborgare. Saken skall läggas fram inom tre år från den tidpunkt då personen i fråga fick vetskap om den åtgärd som givit upphov till beskattning som strider mot bestämmelserna i avtalet. 2. Om den behöriga myndigheten finner invändningen grundad men inte själv kan få till stånd en tillfredsställande lösning, skall myndigheten söka lösa frågan genom ömsesidig överenskommelse med den behöriga myndigheten i den andra avtalsslutande staten i syfte att undvika beskattning som strider mot avtalet. Överenskommelse som träffats skall genomföras utan hinder av tidsgränser i de avtalsslutande staternas interna lagstiftning. 3. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna skall genom ömsesidig överenskommelse söka avgöra svårigheter eller tvivelsmål som uppkommer i fråga om tolkningen eller tillämpningen av avtalet. De kan även överlägga i syfte att undanröja dubbelbeskattning i fall som inte omfattas av avtalet. 4. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna kan träda i direkt förbindelse med varandra i syfte att träffa överenskommelse i de fall som angivits i föregående punkter. Artikel 25 Utbyte av upplysningar 1. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna skall utbyta sådana upplysningar som är nödvändiga för att tillämpa bestämmelserna i detta avtal eller i de avtalsslutande staternas interna lagstiftning beträffande skatter som omfattas av avtalet, i den mån beskattningen enligt denna lagstiftning inte strider mot avtalet. Utbytet av upplysningar begränsas inte av artikel 1. Upplysningar som en avtalsslutande stat mottagit skall behandlas såsom hemliga på samma sätt som upplysningar, som erhållits enligt den interna lagstiftningen i denna stat och får yppas endast för personer eller myndigheter (däri inbegripet domstolar och förvaltningsorgan) som fastställer, uppbär eller indriver de skatter som omfattas av avtalet eller handlägger åtal eller besvär i fråga om dessa skatter. Dessa personer eller myndigheter skall använda upplysningarna endast för sådana ändamål. De får yppa upplysningarna vid offentlig rättegång eller i domstolsavgöranden. 2. Bestämmelserna i punkt 1 anses inte medföra skyldighet för en avtalsslutande stat att a) vidta förvaltningsåtgärder som avviker från lagstiftning och administrativ praxis i denna avtalsslutande stat eller i den andra avtalsslutande staten, b) lämna upplysningar som inte är tillgängliga enligt lagstiftning eller sedvanlig administrativ praxis i denna avtalsslutande stat eller i den andra avtalsslutande staten, c) lämna upplysningar som skulle röja affärshemlighet, industri-, handels- eller yrkeshemlighet eller i näringsverksamhet nyttjat förfaringssätt eller upplysningar, vilkas överlämnande skulle strida mot allmänna hänsyn (ordre public). Artikel 26 Handräckning vid indrivning 1. De avtalsslutande staterna förbinder sig att i enlighet med bestämmelser och regler i respektive stats lagar och förordningar bistå med ömsesidig handräckning och stöd vid indrivning av de skatter på vilka detta avtal tilllämpas när dessa belopp förfallit till betalning enligt lagstiftningen i den avtalsslutande stat som begär handräckningen. 2. Efter framställning av den ansökande staten skall den anmodade staten vidta åtgärder för att säkerställa indrivning av skatt, även om skattefordran har överklagats eller om ingen verkställighetstitel ännu föreligger såvida det är tillåtet enligt lag och administrativ praxis i den anmodade staten. 3. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna skall överlägga om sättet att genomföra tillämpningen av denna artikel i det fall de anser att bistånd med handräckning vid indrivning av skatter är genomförbar. Artikel 27 Begränsning av förmåner Utan hinder av övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal skall, om a) ett bolag med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar sina inkomster huvudsakligen från andra stater 1) från bank-, sjöfarts-, finans-, försäkringsverksamhet, eller 2) genom att vara huvudkontor, co-ordination centre eller en liknande enhet som tillhandahåller administrativa eller andra tjänster till en grupp av bolag som bedriver rörelse huvudsakligen i andra stater; och b) sådan inkomst beskattas - i andra fall än då tillämpning sker av den metod för undvikande av dubbelbeskattning som normalt tillämpas av denna stat - med en skattesats som är påtagligt lägre enligt den statens lagstiftning än den som tillämpas antingen på inkomst från liknande verksamhet som bedrivits inom denna stat eller på inkomst från huvudkontor, co-ordination centre eller en liknande enhet som tillhandahåller administrativa eller andra tjänster till en grupp av bolag som bedriver rörelse i denna stat, bestämmelserna i detta avtal som medför undantag från eller begränsning av beskattningen inte tillämpas på inkomst som sådant bolag förvärvar och inte heller på utdelning som betalas av sådant bolag. Artikel 28 Diplomatiska företrädare och konsulära tjänstemän Bestämmelserna i detta avtal berör inte de privilegier vid beskattningen som enligt folkrättens allmänna regler eller bestämmelser i särskilda överenskommelser tillkommer diplomatiska företrädare eller konsulära tjänstemän. KAPITEL VI AVSLUTANDE BESTÄMMELSER Artikel 29 Ikraftträdande Detta avtal träder i kraft den trettionde dagen efter den dag då den sista av de skriftliga underrättelser - som respektive regering skall lämna när de åtgärder vidtagits som krävs enligt respektive stats lagstiftning - har lämnats och dess bestämmelser skall tillämpas: a) i Portugal 1. beträffande källskatter, om den händelse som givit upphov till skatterna inträffat den 1 januari 2000 eller senare; 2. beträffande andra skatter, på beskattningsår som börjar den 1 januari 2000 eller senare; b) i Sverige 1. beträffande källskatter, på belopp som förvärvas den 1 januari 2000 eller senare; 2. beträffande övriga skatter på inkomst, på skatter som påförs för beskattningsår som börjar den 1 januari 2000 eller senare. Artikel 30 Upphörande Detta avtal förblir i kraft till dess det sägs upp av en avtalsslutande stat. Vardera avtalsslutande staten kan på diplomatisk väg skriftligen säga upp avtalet genom underrättelse härom minst sex månader före utgången av något kalenderår som följer efter utgången av en period om tre år efter det att avtalet trädde i kraft. I händelse av sådan uppsägning upphör avtalet att gälla: a) i Portugal 1. beträffande källskatter, om den händelse som givit upphov till skatterna inträffar den 1 januari det kalenderår som följer närmast efter den dag då den tidsperiod, som angivits i nämnda underrättelse om upphörande, har löpt ut eller senare; 2. beträffande andra skatter, på beskattningsår som börjar den 1 januari det kalenderår som följer närmast efter den dag då den tidsperiod, som angivits i nämnda underrättelse om upphörande, har löpt ut eller senare; b) i Sverige 1. beträffande källskatter, på belopp som förvärvas den 1 januari det kalenderår som följer närmast efter utgången av sexmånadersperioden eller senare; 2. beträffande övriga skatter på inkomst, på skatter som påförs för beskattningsår som börjar den 1 januari det kalenderår som följer närmast efter utgången av sexmånadersperioden eller senare. Till bekräftelse härav har undertecknade, därtill vederbörligen bemyndigade, undertecknat detta avtal och försett detsamma med sina sigill. Som skedde i Helsingborg den 29 augusti 2002 i två exemplar på svenska, portugisiska och engelska språken. Alla tre språken äger lika vitsord. För den händelse att tvist uppkommer vid tolkningen skall dock den engelska texten äga företräde. För Konungariket Sverige Anna Lindh För Portugisiska Republiken António Martins da Cruz Protokoll Vid undertecknandet av avtalet mellan Konungariket Sverige och Portugisiska Republiken för undvikande av dubbelbeskattning och förhindrande av skatteflykt beträffande skatter på inkomst, har undertecknade kommit överens om att följande bestämmelser skall utgöra en integrerande del av avtalet.
